## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language of the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for rapid and efficient development.
- **Lombok**: A library used to make the code cleaner and more readable through annotations.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system used in the application.
- **Redis**: A solution for fast data access and caching.

## Architecture
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ensures the application is modular, extensible, and maintainable by organizing components into independent layers.

## Future Enhancements
- **Rate Limiter**: Can be implemented to control the system load by limiting the number of requests.
- **Cache**: Comprehensive caching solutions can be added to improve performance and access frequently used data faster.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separating command and query operations to achieve better performance and manageability.
- **ElasticSearch**: Can be integrated to enable advanced filtering and search query capabilities.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Automating testing and deployment processes to enhance efficiency.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deployment with Kubernetes can ensure scalability and easier management of the application.
- **Advanced Security and Authorization System**: Implement a robust security and authorization system to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Use authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization.
